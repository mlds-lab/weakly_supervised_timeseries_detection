# Learning Time Series Detection Models from Temporally Imprecise Labels

This is a python implementation of the weakly supervised learning framework for timeseries detection models presented in 

**Learning Time Series Detection Models from Temporally Imprecise Labels** Roy Adams and Benjamin M Marlin. AISTATS 2017.

The model is implemented following the scikit-learn fit predict model. A usage example for toy data can be found in code/examples.py. Dependencies can be found in requirements.txt.
